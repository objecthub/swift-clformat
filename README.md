This framework implements Common Lisp's `format` procedure from scratch in Swift.
`format` is a procedure that can produce formatted text using a format string
similar to the `printf` format string. The formatting formalism is significantly
more expressive compared to what `printf` has to offer. It allows users to display
numbers in various formats (e.g. hex, binary, octal, roman numerals, and even in a
natural language), apply conditional formatting, output text in a tabular format,
iterate over data structures, and even apply `format` recursively to
handle data that includes their own preferred formatting strings.

## API

The primary formatting procedure provided by framework _CLFormat_ is `clformat`. It has
the following signature:

```swift
func clformat(_ control: String,
              config: CLControlParserConfig? = CLControlParserConfig.default,
              locale: Locale? = nil,
              tabsize: Int = 4,
              linewidth: Int = 80,
              args: Any?...) throws -> String
```

`control` is the formatting string. It is using the formatting language described in the
next section to define how the output will be formatted. `config` refers to the control
parser configuration which determines how the control string gets parsed. This parameter
is omitted usually, unless a user wants to define its own control formatting
language. `locale` refers to a `Locale` object which is used for rendering 
locale-specific directives. `tabsize` defines the maximum number of space characters that
correspond to a single tab character. `linewidth` specifies the number of characters per
line (this is used by the justification directive only). Finally, `args` refers to the
sequence of arguments provided for inclusion in the formatting procedure. The control
string determines how these arguments will be injected into the final output that
function `clformat` returns.

## Requirements

The following technologies are needed to build the _CLFormat_ framework. The library
and the command-line tool can both be built either using _Xcode_ or the _Swift Package Manager_.

- [Xcode 14](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [Swift 5.7](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
- [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)
